          <p class="projects__text">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of
            mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
            <br>
            They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to our social
            behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

            If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought in a
            positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our financial well-being and
            prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical
            reality?

            We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset,
            a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but
            it is simple enough if we keep working on it consistently.

            Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into your
            life:

            Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express heartfelt
            gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each
            day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.

            Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements such as “I
            am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time,
            this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.

            Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to achieve, and
            then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way affirmations do. Our
            subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious “truths” will manifest
            in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and you will become so.

            Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one of your
            affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more.
            Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher
            than you ever imagined you could. If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks
            associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and
            aim higher.

            Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even if you can only
            afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.

            Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more
            power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack. Focusing on
            wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?

            Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time, with
            consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought,
            there are truly no limits to what you can create!</p>

          <p class="projects__text">Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at the big ‘R’ of
            recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.
            <br>
            Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk to the far
            side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed as they reach the far side. The
            second person takes much longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in conversations along the
            way as they continue to meet acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you
            like to model your business after?

            Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not. If you
            happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few competitors, that will not last for long.
            You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that when they require your products
            or services, you are the go-to people.

            Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it there is a must.
            This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business. Frequency is a good way to achieve the
            “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I had heard of in the
            past. They run continually with a catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or
            television until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although
            this type of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite high.
            Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence,
            you are paying to market to both those that are your potential customers and a large segment of those who
            are not now and probably never will be your customers.

            There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target market demographic,
            and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be seen by them.

            Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my competition, or
            where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in a flyer or newspaper right
            beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look
            at is diversification. As the saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your
            advertising budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the
            full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may give short term gains
            for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the impression of
            where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.

            Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest and
            greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming down dramatically new options
            such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable, and the paper
            billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and
            motion video footage with computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to
            pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in the door” of
            your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost you money, time and
            effort up front any way that you look at it, but if you have successfully reached your target market, the
            payoffs will be worth it.</p>

            <p class="news__text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that are searching for a
              particular topic. What’s great about them is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
              periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week
              or
              every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth it to get
              your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to
              do it again for at least 6 months.

              2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go when
              they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
              have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
              concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming in the beginning, and
              doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.

              3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your product or service is to
              write
              an article about it. In your authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself and where they can
              go
              to check out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you
              have one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can post on their
              site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the advertising for you. All for free.

              4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise your site. Just type “Free
              URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are promoting and click
              submit. That’s it. It only takes a few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and
              do this.

              5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when you sign up on some
              forums.
              It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge on,
              and
              can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a
              bad
              reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are
              great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get moved to the archives eventually,
              but
              someone could still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

              6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the most
              effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many posts that they received a lot of their profit
              from
              traffic exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of
              buying
              them. I would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like crazy browser. There
              are
              others and they are free to download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your surfing
              in
              at once.

              7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You can usually mail
              the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each day. People
              will tune you out if they see the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
              groups
              with the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
              advertising shaving cream.</p>

            <h3 class="news__subtitle">Four Tips from John Gordon.</h3>
            <p class="news__text">John Gordon, an American business consultant and author of the bestselling books The
              Energy Bus, Soup, The No Complaining Rule and Training Camp, writes and talks a lot about career and
              personal development. Well-known companies and organizations like Wells Fargo, Campbell Soup, Bayer and
              West
              Point Academy listen to his opinion. In one of his blogs, Gordon writes that today's workforce lacks
              motivational leaders. Although this is the immediate task of the management of any company. Here are 4
              tips
              from Gordon on how to motivate the team.

              1. Take time to communicate with the team

              In crisis situations, tension and negative moods in the team build up. Employees do not know what will
              happen to their work, they fear layoffs and are at a loss in what to do next. If you do not communicate
              with
              employees and do not explain their actions to them in such situations, their pessimism can lead to the
              development of a negative scenario. So you risk losing not only part of your business, but also your team.
              And the latter is sometimes more difficult to restore than to find new or return old customers. So make
              sure
              to take the time to communicate with your team. This will allow employees to understand what you expect
              from
              them, where the company is going, and what their role is in this process.

              2. Set a positive example

              Leadership involves the formation and transmission of a certain system of values. Whatever it is, its task
              is to stimulate employees to overcome routine and global challenges that the company faces, to stimulate
              them to work for results. This is rational optimism, without which the productivity of human activity is
              impossible. Its goal is not to force people to close their eyes to challenges, but rather to motivate them
              not to be afraid to deal with them. If a leader demonstrates this approach to problem solving by example,
              it
              is easier for him to convey these values to the entire team.

              3. You must have a vision

              Motivation is not only stories of achievements, but also setting new ambitious goals. An effective leader
              is
              able to show where the company is heading and what the prospects are. Discuss development strategy with
              employees. State what you are doing to implement it now, what needs to be done in the future, and how your
              employees should contribute to this. Listen to their vision for the future of the company. Develop a
              strategy with your team, and then achieving it will be the long-term motivation that every team in
              business
              needs. Show employees that the quality of their work today is the success of the company and their
              personal
              success tomorrow. Demonstrate that it is up to each team member to achieve the goals of the organizational
              development strategy.

              4. Get to know your employees better

              Informal communication plays an important role within the company. If you do not know your employees and
              their interests well, it will be difficult for you to determine the appropriate methods of motivation. The
              task of a leader is to find common ground that can unite the team. One group of people will be united by
              the
              creation of a football team, another by monthly intellectual tournaments or computer games competitions
              ...
              Take time so that you and your employees get to know each other better in an informal setting.

              Motivation is the most important component for any team. Motivated employees work productively, together
              and
              are focused on achieving results. We hope these simple tips will keep your employees motivated at a high
              level.</p>

            <h3 class="news__subtitle">Effective motivation methods.</h3>
            <p class="news__text">1. Awareness
              The best motivation to start a business is the realization of what exactly we need it for, what needs we
              will use it to satisfy. After all, we exist because sometimes we need something, we want something, and
              these desires move us forward. Thanks to them, we are active and proactive. So it is with business, answer
              for yourself the question: “What will I get as a result of opening my own? Why do I need this? " If
              options
              come to mind, for example, money - then dig deeper, what exactly do you want to get from a large amount of
              money? Maybe it's independence, freedom? A desire to receive recognition from a loved one or in general?
              Maybe you want to enter the international market in order to achieve global success? This is a very
              important step, otherwise interest may disappear in the middle of the journey or at the slightest failure.
              It is difficult to move forward with all your efforts and not understand where you are going.

              2. Success magazine key to the book
              Every day, you just need to feel the taste of victory, even a very small one in the form of a minor
              achievement. To do this, you should plan your every day so that the tasks to be completed, the deadlines
              and
              the necessary resources that will be spent are always planned. And each fulfillment of the intended task
              will give a feeling of a little joy, because everything is going according to plan, and accordingly under
              control. This point is especially important for the development of a business in the initial stages,
              thereby
              motivating to continue and claim more. You can even have a so-called "success journal", where you can
              write
              down your slightest victories and completed tasks.

              3.Liability
              We have already talked more than once about the role of responsibility in the life of every person, but I
              will repeat myself here. The more we want to get, the more we will have to do or take risks. And
              accordingly, then bear responsibility for the consequences and results. Therefore, it is important to
              understand that your own business gives you more freedom, but at the same time imposes more obligations.
              You must admit that the life of a person who works, for example, in a bank is very different from the life
              of a person who runs a network business. Yes, he has fewer opportunities in life, but even after work he
              can
              relax, forget about it, having completed his volume of work in a day. While the leader must always be in
              good shape. Therefore, listen to yourself, ambition is very good, but the guarantee of success is the
              ability to act and understand the level of your responsibility, are you ready to bear it?

              4. Comfort zone
              Take a look around, where are you? Are you comfortable living like this? A person is able to achieve
              tremendous success when he risks leaving his own comfort zone. That is, when we get used to something and
              don't change for a long time. It seems to be a comfortable life, but it is very ordinary and without
              development, without gaining new experience, growth ...
              For many years, one and the same salary, sometimes a person can feel completely immobilized, and at the
              same
              time be afraid to risk changing something, suddenly it will become even worse than it is now.
              Therefore, if you are thinking of starting your own business, write a list in which you include all the
              changes that will happen to you. What will change? What scares you? What are the risks? Come up with
              options
              for each controversial moment with which it is possible to solve the situation.
              This will give you more confidence in your abilities, and, therefore, create a basic foundation at the
              beginning of entrepreneurship. By the way, on this blog you can find many quotes about the comfort zone
              here.

              5. Enjoyment of the process people happily work in a team
              In order for there to be a desire to move in a given direction, to go towards your dream, you also need to
              enjoy the process, then there will be no questions about motivation. After all, if you have a goal, for
              example, to achieve financial independence in order to buy a big house, but the tool for realizing this
              goal
              was not chosen correctly - do not hold out for a long time, because energy arises when we do what we like.
              But when you have to do an unloved and not interesting thing, most of your energy is spent on overcoming
              your own resistance in order to force yourself to do something. Therefore, to create your own business, it
              is important to choose the niche that is interesting.
              If you are interested in financial independence, then you can read the basics of achieving it in the
              article: "Can anyone become financially independent and what is required for this."

              6. MLM
              If you are not ready to take big risks, and for a start you want to gain knowledge and experience in the
              field of business, an excellent option is multilevel marketing, if abbreviated as mlm, that is, a network
              where anyone can become an independent distributor, spreading information about a product. This can be
              done
              without even having the initia</p>

            <p class="news__text">There are many things that are important to catalog design. Your images must be sharp
              and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for the text is important. The cover page design and
              the
              design of your catalog’s product pages all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in
              new customers and sales.

              However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of paper you will choose to
              print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important to your potential customers. The longer
              they
              have your catalog in their hands, the more product they will buy. In this article I will go over some of
              the
              many paper choices you have to print your catalog on.

              First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your catalog. In most cases
              the
              cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.

              Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your catalog. Coated paper is for the
              glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can still display your products well.

              So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will my cover be the same
              weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

              Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight of the paper will be. Most
              catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be 60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or
              uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured
              by weight. Some is measured by thickness or “points”.

              Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you can choose from. There
              is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a
              high-end or expensive product.

              There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be printed on. Such as the
              method of printing you are going to choose.

              If you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can choose uncoated or
              coated
              paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press then
              the ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper.

              If your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high quality papers they have
              available. The same goes for printers that do digital printing.

              It will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of paper is available and
              you
              will want to see samples of the paper to get a better idea of which one you want to print your catalog on.
              Also ask your printer to suggest the different types of paper they think will be the best for your
              catalog.

              Here is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for you to choose from or may
              be able to order for you.

              Dull Coated Paper

              Matte Coated Paper

              Glossy Coated Paper

              Antique Paper

              Vellum Paper

              Wove Paper

              Smooth Paper

              Felt Paper

              Linen Paper

              Fiber-added Paper

              Laid Paper

              Parchment

              Four things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch)
              Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper. It affects how your text will stand out on
              the
              pages of your catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is visible from the back of the page. If a paper is
              too
              opaque, your text and images from one page will be seen through onto another page that your customer is
              trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the pages and also how your images will look. The lower
              grade
              finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes sharpen the look of your images.

              Ask your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for printing your catalog
              on the various types of paper before you decide. You know what your budget is and paper is only one of the
              expenses you have to consider.</p>
